      <h2>What is <i>Docker?</i></h2>
      <p>Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. 
	     <br>Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density.</br> Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps. .</p>

	  <h2>What is <i>Nginx?</i></h2>
      <p>NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. 
	   <br>In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</br></p>
